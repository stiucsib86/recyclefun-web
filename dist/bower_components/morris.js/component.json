  "readme": "# Morris.js - pretty time-series line graphs\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/oesmith/morris.js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/oesmith/morris.js)\n\nMorris.js is the library that powers the graphs on http://howmanyleft.co.uk/.\nIt's a very simple API for drawing line, bar, area and donut charts.\n\nCheers!\n\n\\- Olly (olly@oesmith.co.uk)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (>= 1.7 recommended, but it'll probably work with older versions)\n- [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) (>= 2.0)\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [the website](http://oesmith.github.com/morris.js/).\n\n## Development\n\nVery daring.\n\nFork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)\n\n### Developer quick-start\n\nYou'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org).  I recommend using\n[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for installing node in\ndevelopment environments.\n\nWith node installed, install [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) using\n`npm install -g grunt`, and then the rest of the test/build dependencies\nwith `npm install` in the morris.js project folder.\n\nOnce you're all set up, you can compile, minify and run the tests using `grunt`.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 0.4.3 - 12th May 2013\n\n- Fix flickering hover box [#186](https://github.com/oesmith/morris.js/issues/186)\n- xLabelAngle option (diagonal labels!!)
